In class Robot is it necessary to check the requests
passing through the server? 
So: client enter ID -> server -> check into server
-> response to the client ...

In class AdminClient how do I call the method showListOfRobots?
Do I have to create an AdminClient ac = new AdminClient()? 
Is it useful and correct?
